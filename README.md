# Chest X-ray Diagnoisis
In this project chest x-ray classification is presented.

## Dataset
108,948 frontal-view X-ray images of 32,717 unique patients.

## Data analysis(EDA)
For the purpose of analysisng the dataset, module "data_analysis.py" is created. This module has a class Data_analysis. The methods associated to that class are 
1. data_insight()
2. image_visualization()
3. pixel_distrubution()
4. class_imblance_predection()

## Data Preprocessing
Normalize images : new mean of the data will be zero, and the standard deviation of the data will be 1. In other words each pixel value in the image with a new value calculated by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
